<!--
One of the most popular elements in HTML is the <div> element. 
    <div> is short for “division” or a container that divides the page into 
        sections.

<div>s don’t inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful
     when we want to apply custom styles to our HTML elements.

<body>
    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
    <!-- 
      Below the <h1> heading that says The Brown Bear,
      add an opening <div> tag. 
      -->
    <div>
      <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
      <h3>Species</h3>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <!-- 
        Place the closing </div> tag after the <h3> element that says Features. 
        Remember to use your space bar to add two spaces of indentation 
        when you nest elements.

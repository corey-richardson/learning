<!--
HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships.
 As you saw in the last exercise, we placed <p> tags within <body> tags.
When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered 
the child of that element. The child element is said to be nested inside
of the parent element.

<body>
  <p>This paragraph is a child of the body</p>
</body>

<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This paragraph is a child of the body element</p>
    <!-- Add the paragraph below as a child of the div element. -->
    <div>
        <p>This paragraph is a child of the div element and a grandchild of the body element</p>
    </div> 
  </body>

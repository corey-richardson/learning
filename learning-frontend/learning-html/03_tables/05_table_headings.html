<!--
Table data doesnâ€™t make much sense without titles to describe what the 
data represents.
To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table 
heading element: <th>.
-->

<!--

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
    <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Temperature</th>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>

OUTPUTS:

                Saturday    Sunday
Temperature     73          81

-->

<!--
Note, also, the use of the scope attribute, which can take one of two values:
    row - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.
    col - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.
-->

<!--
In the first row, add three table headings. The headings should contain the 
following data, in order:
    Company Name
    Number of Items to Ship
    Next Action

Add a scope attribute to each of these new headings.

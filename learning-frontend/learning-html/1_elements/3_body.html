<!--
One of the key HTML elements we use to build a webpage is the body element. 
Only content inside the opening and closing body tags can be displayed to 
the screen.

<!-- Add a body to your web page using the <body> element. -->
<body>
    <!-- Add a paragraph in the body. -->
    <p>"Life is very short and what we have to do must be done in the now." - Audre Lorde</p>

<!--
While some browsers may render some content outside body tags as well to 
accommodate the occasional mistake in your HTML, not all browsers do this!
The best way to ensure that all your HTML renders the same way in all browsers
is to ensure that your elements remain within the opening and closing 
body tags.

With your new understanding of C# objects and classes, your friend thought you could build a pretty well-organized system of dating profiles.

Your first step? 

Build a Profile class that allows users to generate profile objects.

---

The Profile should store the following information:

- User’s name
- User’s age
- User’s city
- User’s country
- User’s pronouns
- User’s hobbies

---

And this is how users should be able to interact with their own profiles:

- Create a new profile with some information
- Add hobbies
- View profile

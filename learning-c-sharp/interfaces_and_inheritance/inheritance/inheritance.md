Duplicated code leads to errors. Say you have two classes `Sedan` and `Truck`. They’re different types, but they share a few properties and methods, like `SpeedUp()` and `SlowDown()`. If one of those members (say it’s `SpeedUp()`) has to change, then we would have to change the code in every location where `SpeedUp()` is defined.

In this case it’s two classes, but in other programs it may be many more! There are two reasons we don’t want to make the same change on code across multiple files:

- It’s a waste of time
- More importantly, it is a big risk for making mistakes

In this lesson you’ll learn about a solution to this problem: *inheritance*.

With inheritance, you can define one superclass that contains the shared members (like `SpeedUp()` and `SlowDown()`). All classes that need those members can *inherit* them from the superclass.

## Superclass and Subclass

In inheritance, one class inherits the members of another class. The class that inherits is called a *subclass* or *derived* class. The other class is called a *superclass* or *base class*.

In our car example, `Sedan` and `Truck` are subclasses (or derived classes). They will inherit members from a new class called `Vehicle`, which is the superclass (or base class).

Before using inheritance, both classes had:

- `Wheels`, `LicensePlate`, and `Speed` properties
- `Honk()`, `SpeedUp()`, and `SlowDown()` methods
- Similar constructors

We can pull these out of both classes and put it in a `Vehicle` class. `Sedan` and `Truck` will still have access to those members, but we only need to write them in one place.

By the way, this inheritance hierarchy can extend either way: a new `PickupTruck` class could inherit from `Truck`, which inherits from `Vehicle`, which inherits from a new `Machine` class. The only rule is that a class **can only inherit from one base class**, e.g. `Vehicle` can’t inherit from `Machine` and `Contraption`.

## Create a Superclass

A superclass is defined just like any other class:

```c#
class Vehicle
{
}
```

And a subclass inherits, or “extends”, a superclass using colon syntax ( : ):

```c#
class Sedan : Vehicle
{
}
```

A class can extend a superclass and implement an interface with the same syntax. Separate them with commas and make sure the superclass comes before any interfaces:

```c#
class Sedan : Vehicle, IAutomobile
{
}
```


The above code means that `Sedan` will inherit all the functionality of the `Vehicle` class, and it “promises” to implement all the functionality in the `IAutomobile` interface.

## Access Inherited Members with Protected

While working on `Vehicle` and `Sedan`, you may have seen this error:

```
Sedan.cs(11,13): error CS0200: Property or indexer 'Vehicle.Wheels' 
cannot be assigned to -- it is read only
```

Remember `public` and `private`? A `public` member can be accessed by any code outside of the enclosing class. A `private` member can only be accessed by code within the same class.

The above error comes up because either:

- There is no setter for Vehicle.Wheels, or
- The setter is private

How do we fix this problem? Making the setter public is not secure. Making it private is too restrictive – we only want the subclass `Sedan` to access the property. C# has another access modifier to solved that: `protected`!

A *protected* member can be accessed by the current class and any class that inherits from it. In this case, if the setter for `Vehicle.Wheels` is protected, then any `Vehicle`, `Truck`, and `Sedan` instance can call it.

## Removing Duplicate Code

```c#
using System;

namespace LearnInheritance
{
  class Truck : IAutomobile
  {
  	public string LicensePlate
    { get; }
    public double Speed
    { get; private set; }
    public int Wheels
    { get; }
    public double Weight
    { get; }

    public Truck(double speed, double weight)
    {
      Speed = speed;
      LicensePlate = Tools.GenerateLicensePlate();
      Weight = weight;

      if (weight < 400)
      { Wheels = 8; }
      else
      { Wheels = 12; }
    }
    
    public void Honk()
    { Console.WriteLine("HONK!"); }
    public void SpeedUp()
    { Speed += 5; }
    public void SlowDown()
    { Speed -= 5; }
  }
}
```

Make Truck inherit from Vehicle:
- Use colon syntax to announce that Truck inherits the Vehicle class.
- Remove the duplicated properties and methods from Truck.

```c#
using System;

namespace LearnInheritance
{
  class Truck : Vehicle, IAutomobile
  {    
    public double Weight
    { get; }

    public Truck(double speed, double weight)
    {
      Speed = speed;
      LicensePlate = Tools.GenerateLicensePlate();
      Weight = weight;

      if (weight < 400)
      { Wheels = 8; }
      else
      { Wheels = 12; }
    }
  }
}
```

## Access Inherited Members with Base

To construct a `Sedan`, we must first construct an instance of its superclass `Vehicle`.

We can refer to a superclass inside a subclass with the `base` keyword.

For example, in `Sedan`:

```cs
base.SpeedUp();
```
refers to the `SpeedUp()` method in `Vehicle`.

There’s special syntax for calling the superclass constructor:

```cs
class Sedan : Vehicle
{
  public Sedan (double speed) : base(speed)
  {
  }
}
```

The above code shows a `Sedan` that inherits from `Vehicle`. The `Sedan` constructor calls the `Vehicle` constructor with one argument, `speed`. This works as long as `Vehicle` has a constructor with one argument of type `double`.

Even if we don’t use `base()` in `Sedan`, it will call a `Vehicle` constructor. Without an explicit call to `base()`, any subclass constructor will implicitly call the default parameterless constructor for its superclass. For example, this code implicitly calls `Vehicle()`:

```cs
class Sedan : Vehicle
{
  // Implicitly calls base(), aka Vehicle()
  public Sedan (double speed)
  {
  }
}
```

The above code is equivalent to this:

```cs
class Sedan : Vehicle
{
  public Sedan (double speed) : base()
  {
  }
}
```

This code will **ONLY** work if the constructor `Vehicle()` exists. If it doesn’t, then an error will be thrown.

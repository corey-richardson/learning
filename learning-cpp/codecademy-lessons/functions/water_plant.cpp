/*
Define a function needs_water() that accepts:

An int number of days since the previous watering.
A bool value is_succulent. (A value of true would indicate that the plant is a succulent.)
Inside the function, youâ€™ll need some conditional logic:

If is_succulent is false and days is greater than 3, return "Time to water the plant.".
If is_succulent is true and days is 12 or less, return "Don't water the plant!".
If is_succulent is true and days is greater than or equal to 13, return "Go ahead and give the plant a little water.".
Otherwise, return "Don't water the plant!".

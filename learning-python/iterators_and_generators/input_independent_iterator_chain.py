# An input-dependent iterator will terminate based on the length of one or more
# input values. They are great for working with and modifying existing iterators.
# chain() takes in one or more iterables and combine them into a single iterator.

# import itertools
# odd = [5, 7, 9]
# even = {6, 8, 10}
# all_numbers = itertools.chain(odd, even)
# for number in all_numbers:
#   print(number)

# Imports the itertools module.
# Sets all_numbers to the iterator returned by the itertool chain().
# Uses the list iterable odd and the set iterable even as the arguments to chain().
# Implements a for loop using the iterator in all_numbers
# Prints the results, which will be:
# 5 7 9 8 10 6
# Python sets are not ordered so the last 3 numbers in this exampleâ€™s output will 
# not always be in the initialized order.

```py
dog_foods = {
    "Great Dane Foods": 4,
    "Min Pip Pup Foods": 10,
    "Pawsome Pup Foods": 8
}
for food_brand in dog_foods:
    print (food_brand + " has " + str(dog_foods[food_brand]) + " bags")
```

1. The for loop will first retrieve an iterator object for the dog_foods 
dictionary using iter().

2. Then, next() is called on each iteration of the for loop to retrieve 
the next value. This value is set to the for loopâ€™s variable, food_brand.

3. On each for loop iteration, the print statement is executed, until finally,
 the for loop executes a call to next() that raises the StopIteration exception.
  The for loop then exits and is finished iterating.

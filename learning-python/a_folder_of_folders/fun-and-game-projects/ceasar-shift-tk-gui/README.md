# Ceasar-Shift-TK-Gui
Ceasar Shift GUI allowing for both encoding and decoding

How I could improve this?
- Currently this program will convert all alpha characters to lowercase. I could add support for uppercase characters to
- - if char is upper, use "ALPHABET" list instead of "alphabet" list
- Place the two buttons on the same row to improve aesthetics
- Currently doesn't shift numeric characters
- It also doesn't shift punctuaction, however I believe this may be overkill. :)

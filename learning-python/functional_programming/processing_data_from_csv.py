# When working with a file that contains a large amount of data, generating 
# every possible record using tuple() is inefficient. Recall from the previous 
# exercise that map() returns an iterator that we can use to bring in data. 
# We can apply the higher-order functions to this iterator to process the data
# and only bring in the relevant set of records.

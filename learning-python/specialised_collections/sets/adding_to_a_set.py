# There are two different ways to add elements to a set:
# The .add() method can add a single element to the set.
# The .update() method can add multiple elements.

# Neither of these methods will add a duplicate item to a set.
# A frozenset can not have any items added to it and so neither of these 
# methods will work.
# Notice that when the elements are printed, they are not printed in the same 
# order in which they entered the set. This is because set and frozenset 
# containers are unordered.

# lists are not optimized for appending and popping large amounts of data, 
# although they are great at accessing data at any index which you provide.
# To solve this problem, we can use deque containers. 
# These are similar to lists, but they are optimized for appending and
# popping to the front and back, rather than having optimized accessing. 
# Because of this, they are great for working with data where you donâ€™t need 
# to access elements in the middle very often or at all.
